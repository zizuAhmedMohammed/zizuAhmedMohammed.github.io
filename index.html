            The inspiration for a unique word and total word counter project
            could stem from a variety of sources. One possible reason for
            creating such a project might be to aid in language analysis or
            natural language processing tasks. Counting unique words and total
            words in a text document can provide insights into the complexity of
            the language used, and may be helpful for researchers, linguists, or
            language learners. Another possible inspiration for this type of
            project could be to improve the efficiency of editing or writing
            workflows. By automating the process of counting unique and total
            words, writers or editors can save time and ensure accuracy in their
            work. This may be especially useful for professionals who frequently
            work with large documents or who need to quickly assess the content
            of multiple files. Finally, this project could also be inspired by a
            desire to learn new programming skills or to create a useful tool
            for personal use. By building a unique word and total word counter,
            programmers can gain experience with file manipulation, data
            structures, and string manipulation. Additionally, the tool may be
            useful for personal projects or tasks, such as analyzing text-based
            data or tracking word counts in personal writing projects.
